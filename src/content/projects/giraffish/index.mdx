GirafFISH was an experimental Python project I made that tried to enable users to create conversational AI clones of themselves using Meta's 7B LLaMA model. The project integrated with Discord through the py-cord library, allowing users to train their AI clone through natural conversations with it.

## Key Features

- **AI Clone Creation**: Generate a personalized conversational AI using LLaMA
- **Discord Integration**: Train and interact with your AI clone via Discord bot
- **Iterative Training**: Improve the AI through ongoing conversations
- **Local Model Generation**: Self-hosted AI processing for privacy

## Technical Requirements

- **GPU**: Minimum 20GB VRAM required
- **Technologies**: Discord py-cord API, Meta's LLaMA model
- **License**: Apache 2.0

## Project Status

This project has been **archived** as of May 24, 2023. It served as a proof-of-concept for personalized AI cloning and demonstrated the potential for creating self-hosted conversational agents before the widespread availability of more accessible AI platforms.

The project required significant computational resources and was designed as an experimental platform for users interested in exploring AI personality modeling and conversational agent development.

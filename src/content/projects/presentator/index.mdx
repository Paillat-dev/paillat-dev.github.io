Presentator is one of my more ambitious Discord bot projects - it can generate complete PowerPoint presentations on literally any topic you throw at it. The idea came to me when I was procrastinating on creating slides for a school presentation and thought "wouldn't it be cool if AI could just do this for me?"

The bot uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate comprehensive content about whatever subject you specify, then automatically formats it into a proper presentation using Marp (a markdown-to-presentation converter). What makes it really cool is that it doesn't just create text slides - it can also generate relevant images using either Stable Diffusion or DALL-E 2 to make the presentations visually engaging.

The workflow is surprisingly smooth: you just use the `/present` command with your topic, and the bot handles everything else. It sends the topic to GPT-3, gets back structured content in Marp markdown format, extracts image requirements, generates those images, and finally compiles everything into both PDF and HTML versions of your presentation.

I built it with Python using Pycord for the Discord integration, and it supports multiple image generation backends depending on whether you want to run Stable Diffusion locally (if you have a decent GPU) or use DALL-E 2 through the API. The `/list` and `/get` commands let you manage your generated presentations, which is handy since you might want to reference them later.

It's been really useful for quickly creating presentation outlines or even complete slide decks when I need to explain complex topics. The AI does a surprisingly good job at structuring information logically and the image generation adds that professional touch that makes presentations actually engaging to look at.

### Linting and Formatting

Since I wanted to learn as most as I could by making this first project, I also setup [scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/) for code formatting and [scalafix](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/) for code linting, not that they would be particularly useful in this context.
